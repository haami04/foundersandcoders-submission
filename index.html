        <p  align="left" style="font-family:Inconsolata; style="color;="#f0056b3;"> My name is Haamidah, and I am a 19-year-old aspiring web developer. I currently work part-time as a waitress at a pizza place, balancing my job with my passion for coding. I will be turning 20 on the deadline day of this application, marking a significant milestone in my life! </p>
        <p  align="left" style="font-family:Inconsolata; style="color;="#f0056b3;"> Last summer, I made a pivotal decision to leave further education and seek alternative methods to learn web development. This decision led me to discover bootcamps like Founders and Coders, which offer a more hands-on and holistic approach to coding education. This programs align perfectly with my belief in learning by doing, providing immersive experiences that bridge the gap between theory and practice.</p>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2 align="right" style="font-family:'Karla';">What do I like? </h2>
    <p align="right"style="font-family:Inconsolata;" style="color:#001861;"> I have a wide range of interests that keep me engaged and inspired. One look at the stickers on the back of my laptop reveals my love for anime. I also enjoy reading and collecting manga, with a personal goal of owning a volume of every series I’ve read. Although I'm not as much of a bookworm as I used to be, I still find joy in exploring new stories. In my spare time, I also build Gundam models and have plans to start customizing them, adding a personal touch to each creation. </p>

    <h2 align="left" style="font-family:'Karla';">Why Web Development? </h2>
    <li align="left" style="font-family:'Inconsolata';">My interest in web development is driven by several factors:</li>
    <br>
    <li align="left" style="font-family:'Inconsolata';">Firstly, it is an accessible field where one can see tangible progress with consistent practice. The immediate feedback loop in coding allows for quick learning and skill refinement, making it an ideal discipline for those who thrive on hands-on experience.</li>
    <br>
    <li align="left" style="font-family:'Inconsolata';">Secondly, web development offers diverse career opportunities, ranging from front-end design to back-end development, and even specialized roles such as UX/UI design or DevOps. This variety ensures that there is always a new challenge to tackle and a new skill to acquire.</li>
    <br>
    <li align="left" style="font-family:'Inconsolata';">Lastly, web development is inherently creative; it combines technical problem-solving with artistic design, allowing developers to create engaging and functional digital experiences! (Although, my creativity can only go so far with my limited range of front end skills,,,ಥ‿ಥ)</li>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2 align="right" style="font-family:Karla; style="color;="#f0056b3;">So, Why Founders and Coders?</h2>
    <p align="right" style="font-family:'Inconsolata';">I managed to attend one coding meetup, and I instantly fell in love. Everybody involved was so welcoming, kind, patient and they explained things really, really well! If I am lucky enough to be accepted into this cohort, it would be an absolute honour and privilege to work with everybody involved,<br>
        Learning web development from a bootcamp like founders and coders offers me a structured curriculum that quickly takes me from a casual novice, to job-ready. The hands-on experience with real-world projects will help me build a strong portfolio, and the up-to-date curriculum ensures I learn relevant skills.
<br>
        Many of the FAC instructors are able to provide valuable insights and mentorship, and the intensive learning environment allows me to absorb a lot in a short time. Plus, job placement assistance and networking opportunities increase my chances of landing a job after completion! <br>The cohort-based learning provides a supportive community, and the flexible formats fit my schedule. Overall, a bootcamp is a cost-effective, efficient way for me to start a career in web development. </p>
